We are using the CC BY 4.0 (included in the repostory). This is the
default license that applies to all `.penpot` files that does not have
explicit license. This license applies to the `.penpot` file itself
and the original content (made by penpot).

Some penpot files has third-party content (assets, images, etc.)
licensed with other OpenSource licenses; in this case the content
license applies (only to assets that already have their own license).

And some penpot files are just containers for third-party content
(assets, icons, etc.); in this case, the third-party licence will
apply (and accordingly will be mentioned in the .LICENSE file).

If you want to **contribute** with your own **libraries and designs**
you can do it in two ways:

- 🤟 Create a pull request in this repository by uploading your penpot file.
- 📧 Send us your penpot file to *info@penpot.app*

The Penpot team will review all libraries and template
contributions. The approved files will be available in this repository
for other users to free use. The penpot team is not responsible for
maintaining third-party libraries and reserves the right to remove
them from the repository in case the author does not respond to
possible bugs in it.

The contributed files should be licensed with a recognised OpenSource
license. If the license is different that the official one, you should
